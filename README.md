# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help a key investor better understand Hawaii weather temperatures and its fluctuations throughout the year. This will help determine if his investment in a surf shop would be sustainable throughout the entire year or if it would be affected by weather. Specifically, this analysis looks at the temperature for June and Decemeber. Temperature data is gathered through queries in the hawaii.sqlite dataset. The queries are then stored in a list and then converted into a dataframe where summary statistics can be easily determined. 

## Results

Fig. 1 and 2 show the summary statistics table for June and December respectively. 

- Average recorded temperature in June is about 4 degrees F more than the average temperature in December, suggesting similar temperatures between two extreme seasons.
- The minimum temperature recorded in December is 8 degrees F lower than the minimum recorded temperature in June suggesting a greater range of potential temperatures in December. 
- The maximum temperatures between June and December are similar, providing futher evidence of similar temperatures between both seasons. 

## Summary
Overall, the weather in June and December are similar, though the range of temperatures in December can be slightly more varied (specifically with lower temperatures). Therefore, it does not seem like weather would affect the sustainability of a surf shop, though additional queries listed below for analysis would be helpful. 
- precipitation difference to determine rain levels, which could affect surfing conditions
- wind conditions, which could also affect surfing conditions
- filter results by the stations closest to where the shop would be located and where major surfing excursions take place to gauge the most relevant weather conditions
